# Moneyball

This is the repository for the Moneyball assignment from the Iron Yard in Durham, NC.

The assignment was to analyze real-world baseball statistics in order to calculate the On-Base Percentage (OBP) for each player, then to assemble a roster of players for a ball team based upon their OBP and salary. 
The purpose of this assignment was to become more familiar with pandas. Please find my findings in the Jupyter Notebook file. This assignment is complete, however the data is inaccurate due to a mistake when merging dataframes. I intend to fix the findings with time permitting.
